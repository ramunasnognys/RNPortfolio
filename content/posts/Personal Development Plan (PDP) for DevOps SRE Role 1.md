Document your progress, seek feedback, and continuously adapt your learning path based on industry trends and personal interests.

```python
# Example progress tracking script
def track_progress(goals, timeline):
    progress = {
        'technical_skills': [],
        'projects': [],
        'certifications': []
    }
    # Implementation details
    return progress
```
